# Password_validator

A program to make sure that a password is complex so that it cannot be easily guessed. 

The password validator will check multiple aspects of a potential password and will report back to the user if their password meets a set of rules.

The rules for the password validator are:

* Has at least one uppercase letter
* Has at least one lowercase letter
* Is at least 8 characters long
* Has at least one special character
* We can utilize functions to check for each of these requirements, then create a function to validate a user's password.

This program ls split into 5 functions:

* A function that verifies the password has an uppercase letter.
* A function that verifies the password has a lowercase letter.
* A function that verifies the password is at least 8 characters
* A function that verifies the password has a special character.
* A function that reports to the user if their password is complex enough, and if not, tells them what they are missing.
